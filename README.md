Heart Disease Prediction

Objective:
Build a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient health data.

Dataset:
-> Heart Disease UCI Dataset
-> Source: Kaggle
-> Includes clinical features such as age, cholesterol, chest pain type, heart rate, and ECG results.

Models Used:
-> Logistic Regression
-> Data preprocessing included cleaning, train–test split, and feature scaling.

Results & Insights:
The model achieved strong accuracy and demonstrated good class separation as shown by the ROC curve and confusion matrix. 
Features like chest pain type, maximum heart rate, and ST depression were key contributors to prediction, indicating that ML can be a useful tool for early heart disease risk assessment.
