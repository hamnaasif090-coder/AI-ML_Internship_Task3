# Heart Disease Prediction

## Objective
Build a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient health data.

## Dataset
- **Heart Disease UCI Dataset**
- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)
- Includes clinical features such as:
  - Age
  - Cholesterol
  - Chest pain type
  - Maximum heart rate
  - ECG results
  - ST depression, and more

## Models Used
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Data Preprocessing:** 
  - Cleaning missing values
  - Train–test split
  - Feature scaling (standardization)

## Results & Insights
- The model achieved strong accuracy and demonstrated good class separation as shown by the ROC curve and confusion matrix.
- Key features influencing predictions included:
  - Chest pain type
  - Maximum heart rate
  - ST depression
- These results indicate that machine learning can be a useful tool for early risk assessment of heart disease.
